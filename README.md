Version-1:

A very basic attendance portal with less functionalities and styled applied to it.
Used default sqlite3 as backend as it doesn't deal with data storage.

Version-1.2:

An enhanced version of the previous one with few functionalities and more styles added to make it a small level project.
Used MySQL as backend database to collect student details, their attendance status and for validation.
